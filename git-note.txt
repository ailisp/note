* Fork and upstream
git clone git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-FORKED-REPO.git
cd YOUR-FORKED-REPO
git remote add upstream git://github.com/ORIGINAL-DEV-USERNAME/REPO-YOU-FORKED-FROM.git
git fetch upstream

* Keep fork up to date
git pull upsteam master
git push (origin master)

* Reset to one commit
Just look: git checkout commit
Really (after that will be lost): git reset --hard commit

* Manage commit and commit message
git rebase -i origin branch

* Push a upstream branch to fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout -b newbranch upstream/newbranch
git push -u origin newbranch
