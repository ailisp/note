find path action filter-> walk-directory and do action
default action is print (show file name)
default path is ., can give several path together
default filter is none

possible filter:
-name "fullname" "regex-name"
-iname "ignore-the-case-name"
-maxdepth
-type f or -type d: only search file or directory
  -type d/f -empty
-perm 0666
  -perm 1666 2666 sticky bit / sgid bit set
  -perm /u=s suid set
  -perm /a=x executable
  -perm /u=r readonly files
-user who
-group which
-ctime: metadata changed (e.g. permission)
-mtime days
-atime days
(or -mtime +50 -mtime -100, modified between 50 to 100 days)
(note 50 is same as -50!)
-mmin
-size

combine filter:
-not (or !) -name
-name "a.*" ! -name "*.c": find file name "a" and type not "c"
-o means or

Some example for actions:
largest files (delete -r to get smallest files), a different action using -exec
find . -type f -exec ls -s {} \; | sort -n -r | head -5
list files
find . -exec ls -ld {} \;
delete
find /tmp -type f -name "*.txt" -exec rm -f {} \;
